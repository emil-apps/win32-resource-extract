# Win32 Resource Extractor
Easily extract PE32 resources from EXEs and DLLs!

## Getting started
1. Download the compiled exe (extract.exe) or compile it yourself.
2. The program will extract right in that folder without creating sub-directories, so you should do that if file organization matters for you.
4. Open a command prompt in the folder containing the extract.exe file and the resource you want to extract.
5. Run the command `extract.exe <file_name_here>` to extract all resources.
6. Finished!
